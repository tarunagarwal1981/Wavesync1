## ✅ How to Verify It Worked

After running the migration, run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM broadcasts;
```

Should return: `0` (zero broadcasts, but table exists)

```sql
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name LIKE '%broadcast%';
```

Should return: 6 function names
