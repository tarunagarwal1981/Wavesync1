## üêõ Troubleshooting

### No Announcements Showing?

**Check:**
1. Database migration ran successfully
2. User is logged in
3. There are broadcasts in the database
4. RLS policies are active
5. Check browser console for errors

**Create Test Broadcast:**
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor (as admin):
INSERT INTO broadcasts (
  sender_id,
  title,
  message,
  priority,
  target_type
) VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM auth.users LIMIT 1), -- Use any user ID
  'Test Announcement',
  'This is a test announcement to verify the system is working.',
  'normal',
  'all'
);
```

### Polling Not Working?

**Check:**
1. Network tab shows API calls every 5 seconds
2. No console errors
3. Supabase connection working

### Styles Look Wrong?

**Check:**
1. Ocean Breeze CSS variables loaded
2. CSS modules imported correctly
3. Browser cache cleared
