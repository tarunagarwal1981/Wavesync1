# WaveSync Maritime Platform - Deployment Guide

## Netlify Deployment Configuration

This project is configured for seamless deployment on Netlify with the following optimizations:

### Key Changes Made

1. **Package.json Updates**:
   - Downgraded TypeScript to `^4.9.5` (compatible with react-scripts 5.0.1)
   - Downgraded @types/node to `^16.18.0` for compatibility
   - Added `engines` field specifying Node 16+ and npm 8+
   - Added `preview` and `type-check` scripts
   - Added `serve` package for local preview

2. **Dependency Resolution**:
   - Added `.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps=true` to resolve ERESOLVE errors
   - Updated @types/jest to compatible version `^27.5.2`

3. **Netlify Configuration**:
   - Created `netlify.toml` with optimized build settings
   - Set Node version to 18 for Netlify
   - Added security headers
   - Configured SPA routing with redirects
   - Added cache headers for static assets

4. **TypeScript Configuration**:
   - Updated `tsconfig.json` with proper exclusions
   - Maintained path aliases for clean imports
   - Added build directory exclusion

### Deployment Steps

1. **Local Testing**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

2. **Netlify Deployment**:
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
   - Netlify will automatically detect the `netlify.toml` configuration
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `build`
   - Node version: 18

### Build Optimization

- **TypeScript**: Compatible version with react-scripts
- **Dependencies**: All versions tested for compatibility
- **Security**: Headers configured for production
- **Performance**: Static asset caching enabled
- **Routing**: SPA redirects configured

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter build issues:

1. **Clear cache**: Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then `npm install`
2. **Check Node version**: Ensure you're using Node 16+ locally
3. **TypeScript errors**: Run `npm run type-check` to verify types
4. **Build locally**: Test with `npm run build` before deploying

### Environment Variables

For production deployment, you may need to set:
- `NODE_VERSION=18` (already configured in netlify.toml)
- `NPM_VERSION=8` (already configured in netlify.toml)

The project is now optimized for Netlify deployment with no ERESOLVE errors and proper TypeScript compatibility.
