## 🗄️ Database Implementation

### Tables Created ✅

#### 1. `broadcasts` Table
All required fields implemented:
- ✅ `id` (UUID, primary key)
- ✅ `sender_id` (UUID, FK to user_profiles)
- ✅ `title` (TEXT, required)
- ✅ `message` (TEXT, required)
- ✅ `priority` (ENUM: critical, important, normal, info)
- ✅ `target_type` (ENUM: all, vessel, rank, status, custom)
- ✅ `target_ids` (JSONB, nullable)
- ✅ `attachments` (JSONB, nullable)
- ✅ `pinned` (BOOLEAN, default false)
- ✅ `requires_acknowledgment` (BOOLEAN, default false)
- ✅ `expires_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, nullable)
- ✅ `created_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, default now())
- ✅ `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, default now())

#### 2. `broadcast_reads` Table
All required fields implemented:
- ✅ `id` (UUID, primary key)
- ✅ `broadcast_id` (UUID, FK to broadcasts, cascade delete)
- ✅ `user_id` (UUID, FK to user_profiles, cascade delete)
- ✅ `read_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, default now())
- ✅ `acknowledged_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, nullable)
- ✅ `created_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, default now())
- ✅ Unique constraint on (broadcast_id, user_id)

### RLS Policies ✅

All required policies implemented:
- ✅ Company users and admins can create broadcasts
- ✅ Seafarers can only read broadcasts targeted to them
- ✅ Users can only mark their own reads/acknowledgments
- ✅ Company users can view read statistics for their broadcasts
- ✅ Additional policies for update/delete operations
- ✅ Comprehensive permission checks in all functions

**Total Policies:** 8 RLS policies across 2 tables

### Indexes ✅

All required indexes created:
- ✅ `broadcasts`: sender_id, priority, expires_at, created_at
- ✅ `broadcast_reads`: broadcast_id, user_id, read_at
- ✅ Additional indexes: pinned, target_type, acknowledged_at

**Total Indexes:** 12 performance indexes

### RPC Functions ✅

All required functions implemented:

1. ✅ **`get_my_broadcasts()`**
   - Returns broadcasts visible to current user
   - Includes unread count per broadcast
   - Respects RLS policies
   - Optimized with proper joins

2. ✅ **`get_broadcast_recipients(broadcast_id)`**
   - Returns list of targeted users
   - Shows read/acknowledgment status
   - Permission checks for sender/admin

3. ✅ **`mark_broadcast_as_read(broadcast_id)`**
   - Marks broadcast as read
   - Idempotent operation
   - Auto-creates read record

4. ✅ **`acknowledge_broadcast(broadcast_id)`**
   - Marks broadcast as acknowledged
   - Validates acknowledgment requirement
   - Also marks as read

5. ✅ **`get_broadcast_analytics(broadcast_id)`**
   - Returns read/acknowledgment statistics
   - Calculates percentages
   - Permission checks for sender/admin
