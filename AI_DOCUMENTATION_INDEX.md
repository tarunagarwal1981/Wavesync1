## ‚ùì FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Q: Is this real AI or just automation?
**A:** Real AI using GPT-4/Claude for complex reasoning, not rule-based automation. AI understands context, makes judgments, and learns from feedback.

### Q: What if the AI makes mistakes?
**A:** Semi-autonomous mode requires human approval. AI never acts independently on critical decisions. Fallback to manual mode always available.

### Q: How much does it cost per company?
**A:** Operational cost: ~$0.80 per company per month. Revenue: $199-$999 per company per month. High margins.

### Q: Can we build this ourselves or should we outsource?
**A:** If you have AI expertise in-house, build internally. Otherwise, contract 1-2 experienced AI engineers for 6 weeks.

### Q: What if customers don't adopt it?
**A:** Phased approach with decision gates. If <5 pilot customers after 3 months, pause and reassess. Investment is capped at $130K for Phase 1.

### Q: How long until we see ROI?
**A:** Break-even in 10-18 months. Positive cash flow starting Month 11 (assuming 15-20 customers).

### Q: What's the biggest risk?
**A:** Low customer adoption. Mitigate with customer validation (2 weeks) before starting development.

### Q: Do we need to raise funding?
**A:** Not necessarily. $130K can be bootstrapped if you have positive cash flow. But AI makes you more attractive to investors if you do raise.

### Q: What if a competitor builds this?
**A:** First-mover advantage is 12-18 months. Lock in customers early with annual contracts and continuous innovation.
