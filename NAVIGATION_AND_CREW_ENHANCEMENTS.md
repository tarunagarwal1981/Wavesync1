# Navigation & Company Dashboard Enhancements - Complete Implementation

## ✅ **PROBLEMS SOLVED**

### **1. Navigation Highlighting Overlap Fixed**
- **Issue**: Both "Travel Plans" and "Travel Documents" were getting highlighted simultaneously
- **Root Cause**: Both navigation items pointed to the same route `/travel`
- **Solution**: Implemented custom highlighting logic to only highlight the first travel item

### **2. Smart Crew Directory Created**
- **Issue**: Company User pages lacked realistic data and smart functionality
- **Solution**: Built comprehensive crew directory with advanced filtering and dummy data

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **🔧 Navigation Highlighting Fix**

#### **Updated NavigationItem Interface**
```typescript
export interface NavigationItem {
  // ... existing properties
  dataSection?: string; // For handling multiple items pointing to same route
}
```

#### **Enhanced SidebarBase Component**
```typescript
// Custom active logic for travel items to prevent overlapping highlights
const isActive = ({ isActive: routeActive }: { isActive: boolean }) => {
  if (!routeActive) return false;
  
  // For travel route, only highlight the first travel item to prevent overlap
  if (item.href === '/travel') {
    return item.dataSection === 'plans' || item.dataSection === 'planning';
  }
  
  return routeActive;
};
```

#### **Navigation Configuration Updates**
- **Seafarer**: Added `dataSection: "plans"` and `dataSection: "documents"`
- **Company User**: Added `dataSection: "planning"` and `dataSection: "documents"`
- **Result**: Only "Travel Plans" (Seafarer) and "Travel Planning" (Company) get highlighted
