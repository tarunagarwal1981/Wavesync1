## 📖 Usage Examples

### For Developers

```typescript
import { getNavigationForRole } from '@/utils/navigationConfig';

// Get navigation for seafarer
const seafarerNav = getNavigationForRole('seafarer');
// Will include announcements in Main Navigation section

// Get navigation for company user
const companyNav = getNavigationForRole('company');
// Will include announcements and create announcement in Administration section
```

**Checking Permissions:**
```typescript
import { hasNavigationPermission } from '@/utils/navigationConfig';

const announcementItem = {
  id: "announcements",
  title: "Announcements",

## 🐛 Known Issues

**None** - All changes verified and tested

## 📝 Notes

1. **Badge Implementation:** The badge property is set to `undefined` to allow for dynamic population. When the backend integration is complete, this can be updated to show unread announcement counts.

2. **Route Protection:** The routes `/announcements` and `/announcements/create` will need to be protected with appropriate role checks when the pages are created.

3. **Icon Choice:** 
   - `Megaphone` was chosen for announcements as it clearly represents broadcasting messages
   - `Plus` was chosen for create action to maintain consistency with other create actions in the app

4. **Positioning:**
   - For seafarers: Placed after Messages as it's related to communication
   - For company users: Placed in Administration section as it's a management function
   - For admins: Placed after permissions as it's a system-wide feature

---

## ✨ Success Metrics

- ✅ **Code Quality:** No linter errors, no TypeScript errors
- ✅ **Pattern Compliance:** Follows exact same pattern as Messages
- ✅ **Completeness:** All three roles have appropriate navigation
- ✅ **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation provided
- ✅ **Future-Ready:** Badge support for dynamic counts
