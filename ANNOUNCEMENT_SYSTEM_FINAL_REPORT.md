## üîß REMAINING FIXES (Minor)

### 1. Remove Unused Variables (8 instances)
**Impact:** Low (TypeScript compiler warnings only)

**Files:**
- `src/components/announcements/AnnouncementAnalytics.tsx`: Remove `import { useNavigate }`
- `src/pages/AnnouncementDetailPage.tsx`: Remove `profile`, `getInitials`
- `src/pages/AnnouncementsPage.tsx`: Remove `navigate`, `profile`
- `src/pages/CompanyAnnouncementsPage.tsx`: Remove `profile`
- `src/pages/CreateAnnouncementPage.tsx`: Remove `user`
- `src/routes/AppRouter.tsx`: Remove unused page imports

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes

### 2. Fix Type Mismatches (2 instances)
**Impact:** Medium (TypeScript errors)

**Issue 1:** `AnnouncementDetailPage.tsx` line 72
- RPC call returns `{}` type, should be `BroadcastWithStatus`
- **Fix:** Add type annotation to RPC call

**Issue 2:** `broadcast.service.ts` line 253
- Supabase query builder can't be used in `.in()` method
- **Fix:** Execute subquery first, then use results

**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes
