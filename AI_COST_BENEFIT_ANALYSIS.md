## üí∞ REVENUE POTENTIAL

### Pricing Strategy Options

#### **Option 1: Per-Company Monthly Subscription (Add-on)**

| Tier | AI Features | Price/Company/Month | Target Customers |
|------|-------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Basic** | - AI assignment suggestions (assistant mode)<br>- Document OCR<br>- Basic chatbot | $199/month | Small companies (5-20 seafarers) |
| **Professional** | - Semi-autonomous agent<br>- Advanced document intelligence<br>- Task automation<br>- Full chatbot | $499/month | Medium companies (20-100 seafarers) |
| **Enterprise** | - Full autonomous agent<br>- Compliance monitoring<br>- Travel optimization<br>- Custom AI workflows<br>- Dedicated support | $999/month | Large companies (100+ seafarers) |

**Revenue Projections:**

| # of Companies | Mix (Basic:Pro:Enterprise) | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue |
|----------------|---------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 10 | 5:3:2 | $4,990 | $59,880 |
| 50 | 20:20:10 | $18,970 | $227,640 |
| 100 | 40:40:20 | $37,940 | $455,280 |
| 500 | 200:200:100 | $189,700 | $2,276,400 |

#### **Option 2: Usage-Based Pricing**

| Metric | Price | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| AI-generated assignments | $10 per assignment | 10 assignments/month = $100 |
| Document processing | $0.50 per document | 100 documents/month = $50 |
| AI chatbot conversations | $5 per 100 messages | 500 messages/month = $25 |
| **Total per company** | | **$175/month average** |

**Pros:** Scales with usage, fair pricing  
**Cons:** Less predictable revenue, harder to forecast

#### **Option 3: Tiered Platform Pricing (AI Included)**

Instead of add-on, make AI core feature and increase base prices:

| Tier | Current Price | New Price (AI Included) | Increase |
|------|---------------|------------------------|----------|
| Basic | $99/month | $149/month | +$50 |
| Professional | $299/month | $399/month | +$100 |
| Enterprise | $799/month | $999/month | +$200 |

**Revenue Impact (100 companies):**
- Current MRR: $29,900 (assuming 40:40:20 mix)
- New MRR: $39,900
- **Increase: $10,000/month = $120,000/year**

## üéØ RECOMMENDATION

### **STRONG GO** ‚úÖ

**Reasons:**
1. **High Customer Value:** $6,050/month value for $499/month price = 12x ROI for customers
2. **Strong Market Differentiation:** No competitors have this level of AI automation
3. **Manageable Investment:** $100-150K development cost, $600-800/month operational
4. **Fast Break-even:** 10-18 months depending on adoption rate
5. **Scalable Revenue:** $240K ARR (Year 1) ‚Üí $1.8M ARR (Year 3)
6. **First-Mover Advantage:** Maritime industry is behind on AI adoption

### **Implementation Approach:**

**Phase 1 Only (Recommended Start):**
- Investment: $100,000 (including $20K buffer)
- Duration: 4-6 weeks
- Risk: Low (single feature, reversible if fails)
- Break-even: 15-20 companies @ $499/month = 5-7 months

**Decision Gates:**
1. **After Phase 1 (Month 3):** If <5 pilot customers or <70% approval rate ‚Üí PAUSE
2. **After Phase 2 (Month 6):** If <20 customers or <75% approval rate ‚Üí REASSESS
3. **After Phase 3 (Month 9):** If <50 customers or <80% approval rate ‚Üí PIVOT

### **Alternative: Lean Start**

If $100K investment is too high:

**Minimal Viable AI (MVA) Approach:**
- Focus: Document OCR + Smart Task Generation only
- Investment: $30-40K
- Duration: 3-4 weeks
- Value: Immediate time savings, lower risk
- Pricing: $99/month add-on
- Break-even: 30-40 companies = 12-18 months

---

## üíº FUNDING OPTIONS

If capital is limited:

1. **Bootstrap:** Use existing cash flow, slower rollout
2. **Pre-sales:** Sell annual contracts upfront (20 companies @ $499 x 12 months = $120K)
3. **Investor Funding:** Raise $250-500K seed round (AI is highly attractive to investors)
4. **Strategic Partnership:** Partner with maritime training center or classification society
5. **Grant Funding:** Apply for maritime innovation grants (IMO, EU Horizon, etc.)
