# üö® RUN THIS NOW TO FIX BUTTONS

## The Problem
Your diagnostic query shows 2 functions are **MISSING**:
- ‚ùå `acknowledge_broadcast`
- ‚ùå `mark_broadcast_as_read`

**This is why the Acknowledge and Dismiss buttons return 404 errors.**

---

## The Solution (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `pvlnhwsooclbarfhieep`
3. Click **"SQL Editor"** in left sidebar
4. Click **"+ New Query"**

### Step 2: Copy the SQL Script
1. Open file: **`fix-missing-rpc-functions.sql`** (in your project)
2. **Select ALL** (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A)
3. **Copy** (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)

### Step 3: Paste and Run
1. **Paste** into the Supabase SQL Editor
2. Click the green **"RUN"** button (or press F5)

### Step 4: Verify Success
You should see this output:
```
function_name            | status
------------------------ | -------------------
acknowledge_broadcast    | Created successfully!
mark_broadcast_as_read   | Created successfully!
```

### Step 5: Test the Buttons
1. Go back to your app
2. Hard refresh: **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)
3. Navigate to Announcements
4. Click on an announcement
5. Try the **Acknowledge** button
6. Try the **Dismiss** button

‚úÖ **Both buttons should now work without 404 errors!**

---

## Verification

After running the script, run this query to verify:

```sql
SELECT routine_name 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
  AND routine_name IN ('acknowledge_broadcast', 'mark_broadcast_as_read')
ORDER BY routine_name;
```

**Expected output:**
```
routine_name
--------------------------
acknowledge_broadcast
mark_broadcast_as_read
```

Both functions should appear!

---

## What the Script Does

The script creates two RPC functions:

1. **`mark_broadcast_as_read(broadcast_id)`**
   - Marks an announcement as read
   - Used by the "Dismiss" button

2. **`acknowledge_broadcast(broadcast_id)`**
   - Marks an announcement as acknowledged
   - Used by the "Acknowledge" button

Both functions include:
- ‚úÖ Security checks
- ‚úÖ Error handling
- ‚úÖ Proper permissions for `authenticated` users

---

## After Running the Script

1. ‚úÖ Acknowledge button will work
2. ‚úÖ Dismiss button will work
3. ‚úÖ No more 404 errors
4. ‚úÖ Announcements can be marked as read
5. ‚úÖ Critical banner will dismiss properly

---

## Still See Errors?

If you still see 404 errors after running the script:

1. **Verify functions were created** (use query above)
2. **Hard refresh browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. **Clear browser cache completely**
4. **Check Supabase logs** for the successful POST requests

**‚è±Ô∏è Time required: 2 minutes**

**üéØ This will fix the buttons 100%**
