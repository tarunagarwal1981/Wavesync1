## 🔐 Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

### Tasks Table Policies

1. **Company users can view all tasks**
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Company users can view all tasks"
   ON tasks FOR SELECT
   USING (
     EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles
       WHERE user_profiles.id = auth.uid()
       AND user_profiles.user_type IN ('admin', 'company_user')
     )
   );
   ```

2. **Seafarers can view their own tasks**
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Seafarers can view their own tasks"
   ON tasks FOR SELECT
   USING (
     assigned_to = auth.uid()
     OR assigned_by = auth.uid()
   );
   ```

3. **Company users can create tasks**
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Company users can create tasks"
   ON tasks FOR INSERT
   WITH CHECK (
     EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles
       WHERE user_profiles.id = auth.uid()
       AND user_profiles.user_type IN ('admin', 'company_user')
     )
   );
   ```

4. **Company users can update tasks**
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Company users can update tasks"
   ON tasks FOR UPDATE
   USING (
     EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles
       WHERE user_profiles.id = auth.uid()
       AND user_profiles.user_type IN ('admin', 'company_user')
     )
   );
   ```

5. **Seafarers can update their task status**
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Seafarers can update their task status"
   ON tasks FOR UPDATE
   USING (assigned_to = auth.uid())
   WITH CHECK (assigned_to = auth.uid());
   ```

6. **Company users can delete tasks**
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Company users can delete tasks"
   ON tasks FOR DELETE
   USING (
     EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles
       WHERE user_profiles.id = auth.uid()
       AND user_profiles.user_type IN ('admin', 'company_user')
     )
   );
   ```

### Similar policies exist for `task_attachments` and `task_comments`

## 🔔 Notification System

### Notification Templates

1. **task_assigned** - When a new task is created
   ```
   Subject: New Task Assigned: {{task_title}}
   Template: You have been assigned a new task: {{task_title}}
   Category: {{category}} | Priority: {{priority}} | Due: {{due_date}}
   ```

2. **task_updated** - When a task is modified
   ```
   Subject: Task Updated: {{task_title}}
   Template: Task "{{task_title}}" has been updated.
   Status: {{status}} | Priority: {{priority}}
   ```

3. **task_completed** - When a task is marked complete
   ```
   Subject: Task Completed: {{task_title}}
   Template: Task "{{task_title}}" has been marked as completed by {{completed_by}}.
   Completed at: {{completed_at}}
   ```

### Notification Trigger

A database trigger `task_notification_trigger` automatically creates notifications when:
- A new task is created (INSERT)
- A task is updated (UPDATE)
- A task is completed (status changed to 'completed')

The trigger function `notify_task_event` handles:
- Template variable replacement
- Notification recipient identification
- Notification record creation
- Proper type casting and error handling

# 2. Create new query
# 3. Copy contents of task-management-setup.sql
# 4. Execute
```

**Script:** `task-management-setup.sql`

**What it creates:**
- Enums (task_status, task_priority, task_category)
- Tables (tasks, task_attachments, task_comments)
- RLS policies for all tables
- Indexes for performance
- Triggers for automatic timestamps

### 2. Run Notification Setup Script

```

**Script:** `task-notification-triggers.sql`

**What it creates:**
- Notification templates for tasks
- Trigger function `notify_task_event`
- Trigger `task_notification_trigger`

### 3. Verify Installation

Check that everything was created:

```sql
-- Check tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name LIKE 'task%';

-- Check enums
SELECT typname FROM pg_type 
WHERE typname LIKE 'task%';

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT tablename, policyname FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename LIKE 'task%';
