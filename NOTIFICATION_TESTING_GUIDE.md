# WaveSync Notification System - Testing Guide

## üß™ Comprehensive Testing Checklist

This guide will help you test all aspects of the notification system to ensure it's working correctly.

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Database Setup Verification

### Step 1.1: Run the Notification Setup Script

1. Open Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy the entire contents of `notification-system-setup.sql`
3. Click "Run" to execute the script
4. **Expected Output:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Notification system setup completed successfully!
   üìã Created notification functions and triggers
   üîî Set up sample notification templates
   üë• Created sample notifications for existing users
   ‚öôÔ∏è Configured default notification preferences
   ```

### Step 1.2: Verify Database Objects

Run these queries in SQL Editor to verify:

#### Check Notification Functions:
```sql
-- Should return 3 functions
SELECT routine_name, routine_type
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_name LIKE '%notification%'
AND routine_schema = 'public';
```

**Expected Results:**
- `create_notification`
- `create_company_notification`
- `create_seafarer_notification`

#### Check Triggers:
```sql
-- Should return 3 triggers
SELECT trigger_name, event_object_table
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_name LIKE '%notification%';
```

**Expected Results:**
- `assignment_notifications_trigger` on `assignments`
- `document_expiry_notifications_trigger` on `documents`
- `vessel_notifications_trigger` on `vessels`

#### Check Notification Templates:
```sql
-- Should return 8 templates
SELECT name, type, subject
FROM notification_templates
ORDER BY type, name;
```

**Expected Results:** 8 rows with templates like:
- assignment_created (success)
- assignment_updated (warning)
- document_expiring_7_days (error)
- etc.

#### Check Sample Notifications:
```sql
-- Should return notifications for your users
SELECT 
  n.title,
  n.message,
  n.type,
  n.read,
  up.full_name as recipient,
  up.user_type
FROM notifications n
JOIN user_profiles up ON n.user_id = up.id
ORDER BY n.created_at DESC;
```

**Expected Results:** Sample notifications for admin, company, and seafarer users.

## ‚úÖ Phase 2: UI Component Testing

### Step 2.1: Check Notification Bell Visibility

1. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Login as admin user:**
   - Email: `admin@wavesync.com`
   - Password: `admin123`

3. **Look for the notification bell** in the header (top-right corner)
   - ‚úÖ Bell icon should be visible

### Step 2.2: Test Notification Center

1. **Click the notification bell**
   - ‚úÖ Notification panel should slide in from the right
   - ‚úÖ Should show a list of notifications
   - ‚úÖ Unread notifications should have a blue background

2. **Check notification details:**
   - ‚úÖ Each notification should show:
     - Icon (emoji) based on type
     - Title
     - Message
     - Time ago (e.g., "2 hours ago")
     - Delete button (appears on hover)

3. **Test "Mark as Read" functionality:**

   - Window 1: Login as `admin@wavesync.com`
   - Window 2: Login as `company@wavesync.com`

2. **Keep both notification centers open**

### Step 3.2: Create Manual Notification via SQL

In Supabase SQL Editor, run:

```sql
-- Create a test notification for the company user

   - ‚úÖ Message: "No notifications yet"

### Test 5.2: Many Notifications

Create multiple notifications via SQL:

-- Create 10 test notifications
DO $$
DECLARE
  i INTEGER;
  user_id UUID;
BEGIN
  SELECT id INTO user_id FROM user_profiles WHERE email = 'company@wavesync.com';
  
  FOR i IN 1..10 LOOP
    PERFORM create_notification(
      user_id,
      'Test Notification ' || i,
      'This is test notification number ' || i,
      CASE (i % 4)
        WHEN 0 THEN 'info'
        WHEN 1 THEN 'success'
        WHEN 2 THEN 'warning'
        ELSE 'error'
      END
    );
  END LOOP;
END $$;
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Notification list should be scrollable

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
  i INTEGER;
  user_id UUID;
BEGIN
  SELECT id INTO user_id FROM user_profiles WHERE email = 'company@wavesync.com';
  
  FOR i IN 1..50 LOOP
    PERFORM create_notification(
      user_id,
      'Performance Test ' || i,
      'Testing notification system performance with notification ' || i,
      'info'
    );
  END LOOP;
END $$;
```

2. **Open notification center**
   - ‚úÖ Should load within 1-2 seconds
   - ‚úÖ Scrolling should be smooth

## ‚úÖ Phase 6: Cross-Browser Testing

Test in multiple browsers:
- ‚úÖ Chrome
- ‚úÖ Firefox
- ‚úÖ Safari
- ‚úÖ Edge

**Check for:**
- Notification panel appearance
- Real-time updates
- Click interactions
- Animations

2. **Test different screen sizes:**
   - iPhone SE (375px)
   - iPhone 12 Pro (390px)
   - iPad (768px)

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Notification bell should be visible and properly sized
- ‚úÖ Notification panel should fit screen width
- ‚úÖ Touch interactions should work

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 8: Security Testing

### Test 8.1: User Isolation

1. **Login as user A** (e.g., company@wavesync.com)
2. **Note the notifications shown**
3. **Login as user B** (e.g., seafarer@wavesync.com)
4. **Check notifications**
   - ‚úÖ User B should NOT see User A's notifications
   - ‚úÖ Each user should only see their own notifications

### Test 8.2: RLS Policy Verification

Run in SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Try to read another user's notifications (should fail)
SET request.jwt.claims.sub = (SELECT id FROM user_profiles WHERE email = 'company@wavesync.com')::text;
SELECT * FROM notifications WHERE user_id != (SELECT id FROM user_profiles WHERE email = 'company@wavesync.com');
```

**Expected Result:** Should return 0 rows (RLS prevents access)

---

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Notification Bell Not Showing Badge

**Cause:** No unread notifications or badge CSS not loaded

**Solution:**
1. Check if there are unread notifications in database:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM notifications WHERE read = false AND user_id = '[your-user-id]';
   ```
2. Check browser console for CSS errors
3. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue 2: Notifications Not Appearing in Real-Time

**Cause:** Realtime subscription not working

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for subscription errors
2. Verify Supabase Realtime is enabled in project settings
3. Check if the notifications table has Realtime enabled:
   ```sql
   ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE notifications;
   ```

### Issue 3: Triggers Not Firing

**Cause:** Trigger might not be created or disabled

**Solution:**
1. Verify triggers exist:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers WHERE trigger_name LIKE '%notification%';
   ```
2. If missing, run the trigger creation section of the setup script

### Issue 4: "Permission Denied" Errors

**Cause:** RLS policies not configured correctly

**Solution:**
1. Check if RLS is enabled:
   ```sql
   SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'notifications';
   ```
2. Verify policies:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'notifications';
   ```
