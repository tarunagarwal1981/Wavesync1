## 🗄️ Database Schema

### **Columns Added to `assignments` Table**
```sql
ALTER TABLE assignments 
  ADD COLUMN response_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
  ADD COLUMN response_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  ADD COLUMN response_notes TEXT;
```

**Response Status Values:**
- `pending` - Awaiting seafarer response (default)
- `accepted` - Seafarer accepted the assignment
- `rejected` - Seafarer rejected the assignment

### **New Table: `assignment_responses`**
```sql
CREATE TABLE assignment_responses (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  assignment_id UUID REFERENCES assignments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  seafarer_id UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  response_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'accepted' or 'rejected'
  notes TEXT,
  previous_status VARCHAR(50),
  new_status VARCHAR(50),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Purpose:** Tracks all responses for audit trail and history

### **Database Function: `respond_to_assignment()`**
```sql
respond_to_assignment(
  p_assignment_id UUID,
  p_response_type VARCHAR,
  p_notes TEXT DEFAULT NULL
) RETURNS JSON
```

**What it does:**
1. Validates the response type (accept/reject)
2. Checks if seafarer has permission
3. Updates assignment status and response fields
4. Creates response history record
5. Triggers notification to company
6. Returns success result
